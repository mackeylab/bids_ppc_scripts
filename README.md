# bids_ppc_scripts

This repo contains scripts for minimal preprocessing pipeline for Mackey Lab data in BIDS.

This script should:

- Convert to nifti, put into `CBPD_bids` directory.
- Fix TOPUP fieldmaps (see link [here](https://github.com/mackeylab/bids_ppc_scripts/blob/master/fix_topup_sequences/README.md)).
- Assign `IntendedFor` field to TOPUP fieldmaps.

At this point, if a subject has fallen asleep or we need to discard some data, the niftis will be edited to reflect this (x # of TRs removed), and subjects/runs that are bad will be added to the `.bidsignore` file. This includes T1s that we don't want to use.

A second script will:
- Run MRIQC on that subject
- Re-run MRIQC group output to auto-add new subjs as they come in
- Run freesurfer on that subjectâ€™s chosen T1 on the `CBPD_Scanning_Data` Google sheet (longitudinal subjects will be figured out, tbd).
- When freesurfer is done, start fmriprep which will then run with precomputed freesurfer inputs.

Then, someone should put eyes on fmriprep `.html` files for each subject run through this, and copy MRIQC outputs including # of resting-state vols  into CBPD Scanning Data file.

There will also be a script to pull only a subset of the columns of MRIQC IQMs and aggregate them into a file to update the `CBPD_Scanning_Data` Google sheet with.

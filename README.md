# BIDS Preprocessing Pipeline

This repo contains scripts for minimal **containerized** preprocessing for Mackey Lab child data in BIDS. These scripts operate in two chunks.

The first chunk is run by the `new_subj_first` script. This does the below:

- Convert to nifti format with [Heudiconv](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), put into `CBPD_bids` directory (see [here](https://github.com/mackeylab/bids_ppc_scripts/blob/master/heudiconv)).
- Fix TOPUP fieldmaps (see [here](https://github.com/mackeylab/bids_ppc_scripts/blob/master/fix_topup_sequences)).
- Assign `IntendedFor` field to TOPUP fieldmaps (see [here](https://github.com/mackeylab/bids_ppc_scripts/blob/master/assign_fieldmaps)).

Next, if a subject has fallen asleep or we need to discard some data, the BOLD niftis will be edited to reflect this (x # of TRs removed), and subjects or runs that are bad will be added to the `.bidsignore` file for documentation for posterity. This includes extra T1s that we don't want to use, so that only the good T1s will be used for fmriprep.

Check the MRI protocol notes (here) or CBPD Scanning Data (here) for whether a participant has fallen asleep, and at what time. If we didn't note when they fell asleep, put the whole run into `.bidsignore`. A script for discarding extra TRs is [here](https://github.com/mackeylab/bids_ppc_scripts/blob/master/fix_topup_sequences/README.md).

The second chunk is run by `new_subj_second` script. This does the below:
- Run [MRIQC}(https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on that subject.
- Re-run MRIQC group output to auto-add new subjects as they come in.
- Run Freesurfer on that subjectâ€™s chosen T1 on the `CBPD_Scanning_Data` Google sheet (longitudinal subjects will be figured out for this, tbd).
- When Freesurfer is done, start fMRIprep which will then run with precomputed Freesurfer inputs.

Then, someone should put their eyes on fMRIprep `.html` files for each subject run through this, and copy MRIQC outputs (including # of resting-state vols kept) into CBPD Scanning Data file.

There will also be a script to pull only a subset of the columns of MRIQC IQMs and aggregate them into a file to update the `CBPD_Scanning_Data` Google sheet with.
